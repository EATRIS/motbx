  freely available tool for gene-centered collection and display of DNA variations.
  LOVD 3.0 extends this idea to also provide patient-centered data storage and storage
  of NGS data, even of variants outside of genes. Metadata for this resource was programmatically
  retrieved from elixir's bio.tools registry.
