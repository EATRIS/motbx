resourceDescription: A freely accessible, public archive of reports of relationships
  among medically important variants and phenotypes hosted by the NCBI. It integrates
  and cross-references data from multiple databases at NCBI. In addition to dbSNP
  and dbVar, it depends on MedGen to represent phenotype, Gene to represent genes,
  and on human RefSeqs to represent the location of sequence variation. Each record
  represents the submitter, the variation and the phenotype. Metadata for this resource
  was programmatically retrieved from elixir's bio.tools registry.
