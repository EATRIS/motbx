resourceDescription: "DisGeNET is a discovery platform containing one of the largest\
  \ publicly available collections of genes and variants associated to human diseases.\
  \ DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal\
  \ models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated\
  \ with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several\
  \ original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype\u2013phenotype\
  \ relationships.\n\nThe current version of DisGeNET (v7.0) contains 1,134,942 gene-disease\
  \ associations (GDAs), between 21,671 genes and 30,170 diseases, disorders, traits,\
  \ and clinical or abnormal human phenotypes, and 369,554 variant-disease associations\
  \ (VDAs), between 194,515 variants and 14,155 diseases, traits, and phenotypes.\
  \ Metadata for this resource was programmatically retrieved from elixir's bio.tools\
  \ registry."
