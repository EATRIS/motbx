resourceDescription: Diagnostic Variant Database (DVD) is a nation-wide human genomic
  variant database launched by Dutch University Medical Centers. Its purpose is to
  share all genetic variants detected in the course of next-generation sequencing
  (NGS) applications between collaborators. It helps medical researchers to distinguish
  between functionally relevant and benign genetic variants. DVD also allows users
  to contact the researcher who originally identified a particular genetic mutation.
  Metadata for this resource was programmatically retrieved from elixir's bio.tools
  registry.
