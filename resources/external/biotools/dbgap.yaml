resourceDescription: The Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP) is a National
  Institutes of Health-sponsored repository charged to archive and distribute the
  data and results from studies that have investigated the interaction of genotype
  and phenotype in humans. Information in dbGaP is organized as a hierarchical structure
  and includes the accessioned objects, phenotypes (as variables and datasets), various
  molecular assay data (SNP and Expression Array data, Sequence and Epigenomic marks),
  analyses and documents. Metadata for this resource was programmatically retrieved
  from elixir's bio.tools registry.
