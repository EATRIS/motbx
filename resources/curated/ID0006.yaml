resourceDescription: NA12878 is a human genomic DNA sample standardised by the National
  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It serves as a reference standard
  for the Genome in a Bottle consortium, which is led by NIST. The donor subject,
  NA12878's mother, carries a single bp (G-to-A) transition at nucleotide 681 in exon
  5 of the CYP2C19 gene (CYP2C19*2). This genetic change creates an aberrant splice
  site, resulting in a 40-bp deletion at the beginning of exon 5 (from bp 643 to bp
  682). As a consequence, amino acids 215 to 227 are deleted from the mRNA, causing
  an alteration in the reading frame and the production of a truncated, nonfunctional
  protein. The truncated protein contains 234 amino acids and lacks the heme-binding
  region, rendering it catalytically inactive.
