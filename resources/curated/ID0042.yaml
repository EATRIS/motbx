resourceDescription: Biomarkers able to predict response and toxicity upon regorafenib
  therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) are critical for treatment choice, particularly
  relevant in fragile patients. Here, we validated for the first time 18 distinct
  microRNAs (miRNAs) detected in serum and primary tumor samples, three germline single-nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor (VEGFR) genes, and low levels of Notch 1 expression in the
  primary tumor as predictive biomarkers of different features. Specifically, these
  markers were associated with a favorable response to treatment, disease stage, and
  relapse, as well as the appearance of asthenia. Therefore, these markers can be
  potentially useful biomarkers for patient stratification and for providing a more
  personalized and effective therapeutic strategy in fragile patients, while limiting
  the appearance of adverse effects.
