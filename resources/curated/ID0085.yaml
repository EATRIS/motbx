resourceDescription: Multi-omics refers to a family of complex experimental designs where researchers apply more than one molecular profiling technology – capturing, for example, the genome, proteome and metabolome – across a common set of biological samples. These experiments offer a wealth of opportunities for subsequent analyses, but the size of the resulting datasets and the diversity of the study designs makes data sharing inherently challenging. In this collection, we present a series of multi-omics studies where the authors have used innovative means to maximize the accessibility and reusability of their datasets.
