resourceCategory: Quality control and assessment
resourceDescription: Universal Human Reference RNA is an RNA extract used as a positive
  control in QuantiGene assays. The Universal Human Reference RNA is composed of total
  RNA from 10 human cell lines (Adenocarcinoma, mammary gland; Melanoma; Hepatoblastoma,
  liver; Liposarcoma; Adenocarcinoma, cervix; Histiocytic lymphoma, macrophage, histocyte;
  Embryonal carcinoma, testis; Lymphoblastic leukemia, T lymphoblast; Glioblastoma,
  brain; Plasmacytoma; myeloma; B lymphocyte). Equal quantities of DNase-treated total
  RNA from each cell line were pooled to make the universal control.
