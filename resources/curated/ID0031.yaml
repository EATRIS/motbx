resourceDescription: "Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform\
  \ and interpret quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments. The problem is exacerbated\
  \ by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes\
  \ a reader\u2019s ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented\
  \ or to repeat the experiments. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative\
  \ Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results\
  \ to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency\
  \ between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of\
  \ guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR\
  \ experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a\
  \ manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions\
  \ and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols\
  \ used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary\
  \ to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published\
  \ either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. Following these guidelines\
  \ will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal\
  \ interpretation of qPCR results."
