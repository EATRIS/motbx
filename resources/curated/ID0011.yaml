resourceDescription: European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) Certifications
  aim to improve the quality of molecular genetic testing. EMQN provides external
  quality assessment (EQA) schemes and educational resources to laboratories worldwide,
  with a focus on genetic testing. Their EQA schemes involve the distribution of samples
  to participating laboratories for analysis, allowing them to assess their performance
  and compare it with other laboratories. This helps identify areas for improvement
  and ensures the accuracy and reliability of genetic testing results. EMQN also offers
  various educational activities, including workshops, conferences, and online courses,
  to enhance the knowledge and skills of laboratory professionals in the field of
  molecular genetics. Through their initiatives, EMQN plays a crucial role in promoting
  quality assurance and standardisation in molecular genetic testing, ultimately benefiting
  patients and healthcare providers.
