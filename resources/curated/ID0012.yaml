resourceDescription: Enhancing Quality in Preclinical Data (EQIPD) quality framework
  and toolbox. The EQIPD Quality System is a comprehensive framework designed to enhance
  the quality and reliability of preclinical research. The EQIPD (Experimental Quality
  In Project Design) initiative aims to improve experimental design and reporting
  standards by providing researchers with practical tools and guidelines. The EQIPD
  Quality System consists of several components, including the EQIPD Quality System
  Wiki, which serves as a knowledge base for researchers to access resources, templates,
  and examples related to experimental design, conduct, and reporting. The system
  also incorporates a training program, quality certification, and an EQIPD Label
  for projects that meet the specified quality criteria. By implementing the EQIPD
  Quality System, researchers can enhance the robustness, reproducibility, and translatability
  of their preclinical studies.
