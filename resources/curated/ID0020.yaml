resourceDescription: "Cytosine modifications in DNA such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC)\
  \ underlie a broad range of developmental processes, maintain cellular lineage specification,\
  \ and can define or stratify types of cancer and other diseases. However, the wide\
  \ variety of approaches available to interrogate these modifications has created\
  \ a need for harmonized materials, methods, and rigorous benchmarking to improve\
  \ genome-wide methylome sequencing applications in clinical and basic research.\
  \ Here, we present a multi-platform assessment and cross-validated resource for\
  \ epigenetics research from the FDA\u2019s Epigenomics Quality Control Group. Each\
  \ sample is processed in multiple replicates by three whole-genome bisulfite sequencing\
  \ (WGBS) protocols (TruSeq DNA methylation, Accel-NGS MethylSeq, and SPLAT), oxidative\
  \ bisulfite sequencing (TrueMethyl), enzymatic deamination method (EMSeq), targeted\
  \ methylation sequencing (Illumina Methyl Capture EPIC), single-molecule long-read\
  \ nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and 850k Illumina methylation\
  \ arrays. After rigorous quality assessment and comparison to Illumina EPIC methylation\
  \ microarrays and testing on a range of algorithms (Bismark, BitmapperBS, bwa-meth,\
  \ and BitMapperBS), we find overall high concordance between assays, but also differences\
  \ in efficiency of read mapping, CpG capture, coverage, and platform performance,\
  \ and variable performance across 26 microarray normalization algorithms. The data\
  \ provided herein can guide the use of these DNA reference materials in epigenomics\
  \ research, as well as provide best practices for experimental design in future\
  \ studies. By leveraging seven human cell lines that are designated as publicly\
  \ available reference materials, these data can be used as a baseline to advance\
  \ epigenomics research. This article serves as recomendations for library preparation,\
  \ sequencing, and data processing of methylome sequencing data."
