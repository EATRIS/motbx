resourceDescription: Gene expression analysis of microRNA molecules is becoming increasingly
  important. In this study we assess the use of the mean expression value of all expressed
  microRNAs in a given sample as a normalization factor for microRNA real-time quantitative
  PCR data and compare its performance to the currently adopted approach. We demonstrate
  that the mean expression value outperforms the current normalization strategy in
  terms of better reduction of technical variation and more accurate appreciation
  of biological changes.
