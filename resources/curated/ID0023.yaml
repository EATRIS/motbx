resourceDescription: Bisulfite sequencing detects 5mC and 5hmC at single-base resolution.
  However, bisulfite treatment damages DNA, which results in fragmentation, DNA loss,
  and biased sequencing data. To overcome these problems, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq)
  was developed. This method detects 5mC and 5hmC using two sets of enzymatic reactions.
  In the first reaction, TET2 and T4-BGT convert 5mC and 5hmC into products that cannot
  be deaminated by APOBEC3A. In the second reaction, APOBEC3A deaminates unmodified
  cytosines by converting them to uracils. Therefore, these three enzymes enable the
  identification of 5mC and 5hmC. EM-seq libraries were compared with bisulfite-converted
  DNA, and each library type was ligated to Illumina adaptors before conversion. Libraries
  were made using NA12878 genomic DNA, cell-free DNA, and FFPE DNA over a range of
  DNA inputs. The 5mC and 5hmC detected in EM-seq libraries were similar to those
  of bisulfite libraries. However, libraries made using EM-seq outperformed bisulfite-converted
  libraries in all specific measures examined (coverage, duplication, sensitivity,
  etc.). EM-seq libraries displayed even GC distribution, better correlations across
  DNA inputs, increased numbers of CpGs within genomic features, and accuracy of cytosine
  methylation calls. EM-seq was effective using as little as 100 pg of DNA, and these
  libraries maintained the described advantages over bisulfite sequencing. EM-seq
  library construction, using challenging samples and lower DNA inputs, opens new
  avenues for research and clinical applications.
