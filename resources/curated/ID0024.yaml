resourceDescription: The NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq library preparation method is
  a powerful tool for studying genome-wide DNA methylation patterns. EM-seq utilizes
  an enzymatic approach to efficiently convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils,
  allowing for interrogation of DNA methylation across the genome at single-base resolution.
  NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq has been shown to provide high sensitivity and accuracy
  for profiling DNA methylation patterns across different genomic context. Furthermore,
  the method offers a streamlined and automated, workflow enabling the generation
  of high-quality libraries for next-generation sequencing.
