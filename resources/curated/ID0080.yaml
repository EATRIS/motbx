resourceDescription: The report  describes the EATRIS-Plus FAIRification strategy
  underpining the development of this resource - the multi-omics toolbox (MOTBX).
  Developed as part of the EATRIS-Plus project, the aim is to provide researchers
  with a comprehensive understanding of molecular profiles in personalised medicine.
  The report focuses on implementing FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability,
  and Reusability) principles to ensure reproducibility and reusability of multi-omics
  cohort data. The EATRIS-Plus FAIRification process is described, including the use
  of standards, formats, and tools. The report emphasises the adoption of the ISA
  metadata framework for capturing experimental metadata along with omics-specific
  data standards. These files adhere to reporting guidelines for individual omics
  types and facilitate integration of multi-omics data in personalised health and
  medicine research projects.
