resourceDescription: Recent studies have demonstrated the genetic significance of
  insertions, deletions, and other more complex structural variants (SVs) in the human
  population. With the development of the next-generation sequencing technologies,
  high-throughput surveys of SVs on the whole-genome level have become possible. Here
  we present split-read identification, calibrated (SRiC), a sequence-based method
  for SV detection. We start by mapping each read to the reference genome in standard
  fashion using gapped alignment. Then to identify SVs, we score each of the many
  initial mappings with an assessment strategy designed to take into account both
  sequencing and alignment errors (e.g. scoring more highly events gapped in the center
  of a read). All current SV calling methods have multilevel biases in their identifications
  due to both experimental and computational limitations (e.g. calling more deletions
  than insertions). A key aspect of our approach is that we calibrate all our calls
  against synthetic data sets generated from simulations of high-throughput sequencing
  (with realistic error models). This allows us to calculate sensitivity and the positive
  predictive value under different parameter-value scenarios and for different classes
  of events (e.g. long deletions vs. short insertions). We run our calculations on
  representative data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Coupling the observed numbers
  of events on chromosome 1 with the calibrations gleaned from the simulations (for
  different length events) allows us to construct a relatively unbiased estimate for
  the total number of SVs in the human genome across a wide range of length scales.
  We estimate in particular that an individual genome contains ~670,000 indels/SVs.
  Compared with the existing read-depth and read-pair approaches for SV identification,
  our method can pinpoint the exact breakpoints of SV events, reveal the actual sequence
  content of insertions, and cover the whole size spectrum for deletions. Moreover,
  with the advent of the third-generation sequencing technologies that produce longer
  reads, we expect our method to be even more useful.
