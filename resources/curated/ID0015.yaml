resourceDescription: Data pre-processing is the obligatory first phase that must precede
  all variant discovery. It involves pre-processing the raw sequence data (provided
  in FASTQ or uBAM format) to produce analysis-ready BAM files. This involves alignment
  to a reference genome as well as some data cleanup operations to correct for technical
  biases and make the data suitable for analysis. This is avaialble as part of the
  Genome Analysis ToolKit's (GATK) best practices and workflows.
