resourceDescription: The powerful HiSeq X sequencers with their patterned flowcell
  technology and fast turnaround times are instrumental for many large-scale genomic
  and epigenomic studies. However, assessment of DNA methylation by sodium bisulfite
  treatment results in sequencing libraries of low diversity, which may impact data
  quality and yield. In this report we assess the quality of WGBS data generated on
  the HiSeq X system in comparison with data generated on the HiSeq 2500 system and
  the newly released NovaSeq system. We report a systematic issue with low basecall
  quality scores assigned to guanines in the second read of WGBS when using certain
  Real Time Analysis (RTA) software versions on the HiSeq X sequencer, reminiscent
  of an issue that was previously reported with certain HiSeq 2500 software versions.
  However, with the HD.3.4.0 /RTA 2.7.7 software upgrade for the HiSeq X system, we
  observed an overall improved quality and yield of the WGBS data generated, which
  in turn empowers cost-effective and high quality DNA methylation studies.
