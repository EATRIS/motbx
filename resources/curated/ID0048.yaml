resourceDescription: The proteomic analysis of human blood and blood-derived products
  (e.g., plasma) offers an attractive avenue to translate research progress from the
  laboratory into the clinic. However, due to its unique protein composition, performing
  proteomics assays with plasma is challenging. Plasma proteomics has regained interest
  due to recent technological advances, but challenges imposed by both complications
  inherent to studying human biology (e.g., interindividual variability) and analysis
  of biospecimens (e.g., sample variability), as well as technological limitations
  remain. As part of the Human Proteome Project (HPP), the Human Plasma Proteome Project
  (HPPP) brings together key aspects of the plasma proteomics pipeline. Here, we provide
  considerations and recommendations concerning study design, plasma collection, quality
  metrics, plasma processing workflows, mass spectrometry (MS) data acquisition, data
  processing, and bioinformatic analysis. With exciting opportunities in studying
  human health and disease though this plasma proteomics pipeline, a more informed
  analysis of human plasma will accelerate interest while enhancing possibilities
  for the incorporation of proteomics-scaled assays into clinical practice.
