resourceDescription: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is
  creating new, economical, qualitative reference materials and data for proteomics
  comparisons, benchmarking and harmonization. Here we describe a large dataset from
  shotgun proteomic analysis of RM 8461 Human Liver for Proteomics, a reference material
  being developed. Consensus identifications using multiple search engines and sample
  preparations demonstrate a homogeneous and fit-for-purpose material that can be
  incorporated into automated or manual sample preparation workflows, with the resulting
  data used to directly assess complete sample-to-data workflows and provide harmonization
  and benchmarking between laboratories and techniques. Data are available via PRIDE
  with identifier PXD013608.
