resourceDescription: Mass spectrometry is a highly complex analytical technique and
  mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments can be subject to a large variability,
  which forms an obstacle to obtaining accurate and reproducible results. Therefore,
  a comprehensive and systematic approach to quality control is an essential requirement
  to inspire confidence in the generated results. A typical mass spectrometry experiment
  consists of multiple different phases including the sample preparation, liquid chromatography,
  mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics stages. We review potential sources of variability
  that can impact the results of a mass spectrometry experiment occurring in all of
  these steps, and we discuss how to monitor and remedy the negative influences on
  the experimental results. Furthermore, we describe how specialized quality control
  samples of varying sample complexity can be incorporated into the experimental workflow
  and how they can be used to rigorously assess detailed aspects of the instrument
  performance.
