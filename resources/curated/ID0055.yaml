resourceDescription: A freely-available and open source Windows client application
  for building Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM)/Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM),
  Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM), Data Independent Acquisition (DIA/SWATH) and
  DDA with MS1 quantitative methods and analysing the resulting mass spectrometer
  data. It aims to employ cutting-edge technologies for creating and iteratively refining
  targeted methods for large-scale quantitative mass spectrometry studies in life
  sciences.
