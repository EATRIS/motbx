resourceDescription: "DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark involved\
  \ in regulation of gene expression. For low input samples, a limited number of methods\
  \ for quantifying DNA methylation genome-wide has been evaluated. Here, we compared\
  \ a series of input DNA amounts (1\u201310ng) from two methylome library preparation\
  \ protocols, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) and post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT)\
  \ adapted from single-cell PBAT. EM-seq takes advantage of enzymatic activity while\
  \ PBAT relies on conventional bisulfite conversion for detection of DNA methylation.\
  \ We found that both methods accurately quantified DNA methylation genome-wide.\
  \ They produced expected distribution patterns around genomic features, high C-T\
  \ transition efficiency at non-CpG sites and high correlation between input amounts.\
  \ However, EM-seq performed better in regard to library and sequencing quality,\
  \ i.e. EM-seq produced larger insert sizes, higher alignment rates and higher library\
  \ complexity with lower duplication rate compared to PBAT. Moreover, EM-seq demonstrated\
  \ higher CpG coverage, better CpG site overlap and higher consistency between input\
  \ series. In summary, our data suggests that EM-seq overall performed better than\
  \ PBAT in whole-genome methylation quantification of low input samples."
