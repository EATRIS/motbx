resourceCategory: Quality control and assessment
resourceDescription: Unmethylated lambda DNA and CpG-methylated pUC19 DNA, two essential
  spike-ins employed in EM-seq library preparation. The unmethylated lambda DNA serves
  to evaluate conversion efficiency, while the CpG-methylated pUC19 DNA acts as a
  control to ensure accurate and reliable results. These spike-ins play a crucial
  role in validating the quality of EM-seq libraries, enabling researchers to achieve
  robust and precise outcomes in their experiments.
