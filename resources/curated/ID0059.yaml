resourceDescription: "The metabolomics quality assurance and quality control consortium\
  \ (mQACC) evolved from the recognized need for a community-wide consensus on improving\
  \ and systematizing quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) practices for\
  \ untargeted metabolomics. Objectives: In this work, we sought to identify and share\
  \ the common and divergent QA and QC practices amongst mQACC members and collaborators\
  \ who use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) in untargeted metabolomics.\
  \ All authors voluntarily participated in this collaborative research project by\
  \ providing the details of and insights into the QA and QC practices used in their\
  \ laboratories. This sharing was enabled via a six-page questionnaire composed of\
  \ over 120 questions and comment fields which was developed as part of this work\
  \ and has proved the basis for ongoing mQACC outreach: For QA, many laboratories\
  \ reported documenting maintenance, calibration and tuning (82%); having established\
  \ data storage and archival processes (71%); depositing data in public repositories\
  \ (55%); having standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place for all laboratory\
  \ processes (68%) and training staff on laboratory processes (55%). For QC, universal\
  \ practices included using system suitability procedures (100%) and using a robust\
  \ system of identification (Metabolomics Standards Initiative level 1 identification\
  \ standards) for at least some of the detected compounds. Most laboratories used\
  \ QC samples (>86%); used internal standards (91%); used a designated analytical\
  \ acquisition template with randomized experimental samples (91%); and manually\
  \ reviewed peak integration following data acquisition (86%). A minority of laboratories\
  \ included technical replicates of experimental samples in their workflows (36%).\
  \ Although the 23 contributors were researchers with diverse and international backgrounds\
  \ from academia, industry and government, they are not necessarily representative\
  \ of the worldwide pool of practitioners due to the recruitment method for participants\
  \ and its voluntary nature. However, both questionnaire and the findings presented\
  \ here have already informed and led other data gathering efforts by mQACC at conferences\
  \ and other outreach activities and will continue to evolve in order to guide discussions\
  \ for recommendations of best practices within the community and to establish internationally\
  \ agreed upon reporting standards. We very much welcome further feedback from readers\
  \ of this article."
