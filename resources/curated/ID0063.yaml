resourceDescription: 'Provides a user-friendly, flexible and easily extendable software
  with a complete set of modules covering the entire MS data analysis workflow, with
  the main focus on LC-MS data. It is based on the original MZmine toolbox described
  in the 2006 Bioinformatics publication (MZmine: toolbox for processing and visualization
  of mass spectrometry based molecular profile data, https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/22/5/634/206500?login=false),
  but has been completely redesigned and rewritten since then.'
