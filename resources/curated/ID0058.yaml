resourceDescription: "The metabolomics quality assurance and quality control consortium\
  \ (mQACC) is enabling the identification, development, prioritization, and promotion\
  \ of suitable reference materials (RMs) to be used in quality assurance (QA) and\
  \ quality control (QC) for untargeted metabolomics research. This review aims to\
  \ highlight current RMs, and methodologies used within untargeted metabolomics and\
  \ lipidomics communities to ensure standardization of results obtained from data\
  \ analysis, interpretation and cross-study, and cross laboratory comparisons. The\
  \ essence of the aims is also applicable to other \u2018omics areas that generate\
  \ high dimensional data. The potential for game-changing biochemical discoveries\
  \ through mass spectrometry-based (MS) untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics are\
  \ predicated on the evolution of more confident qualitative (and eventually quantitative)\
  \ results from research laboratories. RMs are thus critical QC tools to be able\
  \ to assure standardization, comparability, repeatability and reproducibility for\
  \ untargeted data analysis, interpretation, to compare data within and across studies\
  \ and across multiple laboratories. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) that promote,\
  \ describe and exemplify the use of RMs will also improve QC for the metabolomics\
  \ and lipidomics communities. The application of RMs described in this review may\
  \ significantly improve data quality to support metabolomics and lipidomics research.\
  \ The continued development and deployment of new RMs, together with interlaboratory\
  \ studies and educational outreach and training, will further promote sound QA practices\
  \ in the community."
