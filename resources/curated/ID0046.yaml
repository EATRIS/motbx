resourceDescription: Plasma and serum are rich sources of information regarding an
  individual's health state, and protein tests inform medical decision making. Despite
  major investments, few new biomarkers have reached the clinic. Mass spectrometry
  (MS)-based proteomics now allows highly specific and quantitative readout of the
  plasma proteome. Here, we employ Plasma Proteome Profiling to define quality marker
  panels to assess plasma samples and the likelihood that suggested biomarkers are
  instead artifacts related to sample handling and processing. We acquire deep reference
  proteomes of erythrocytes, platelets, plasma, and whole blood of 20 individuals
  (> 6,000 proteins), and compare serum and plasma proteomes. Based on spike-in experiments,
  we determine sample quality-associated proteins, many of which have been reported
  as biomarker candidates as revealed by a comprehensive literature survey. We provide
  sample preparation guidelines and an online resource ( www.plasmaproteomeprofiling.org)
  to assess overall sample-related bias in clinical studies and to prevent costly
  miss-assignment of biomarker candidates.
