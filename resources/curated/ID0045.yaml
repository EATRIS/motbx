resourceDescription: The emergence of MS-based proteomic platforms as a prominent
  technology utilized in biochemical and biomedical research has increased the need
  for high-quality MS measurements. To address this need, National Institute of Standards
  and Technology (NIST) reference material (RM) 8323 yeast protein extract is introduced
  as a proteomics quality control material for benchmarking the preanalytical and
  analytical performance of proteomics-based experimental workflows. RM 8323 yeast
  protein extract is based upon the well-characterized eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  and can be utilized in the design and optimization of proteomics-based methodologies
  from sample preparation to data analysis. To demonstrate its utility as a proteomics
  quality control material, we coupled LC-MS/MS measurements of RM 8323 with the NIST
  MS Quality Control (MSQC) performance metrics to quantitatively assess the LC-MS/MS
  instrumentation parameters that influence measurement accuracy, repeatability, and
  reproducibility. Due to the complexity of the yeast proteome, we also demonstrate
  how NIST RM 8323, along with the NIST MSQC performance metrics, can be used in the
  evaluation and optimization of proteomics-based sample preparation methods.
