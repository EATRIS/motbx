resourceCategory: Internal Quality Control
resourceDescription: "Variation in RNA expression data can be attributed to a variety\
  \ of factors including the quality of the starting material, the level of cellularity\
  \ and RNA yield, the platform employed, and the person performing the experiment.\
  \ To control for these sources of variability, a common set of external RNA controls\
  \ has been developed by the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), an ad-hoc group\
  \ of academic, private, and public organizations hosted by the National Institute\
  \ of Standards and Technology (NIST). The controls consist of a set of unlabeled,\
  \ polyadenylated transcripts designed to be added to an RNA analysis experiment\
  \ after sample isolation, in order to measure against defined performance criteria.\
  \ Up until the design of such universally accepted controls, it has been difficult\
  \ to execute a thorough investigation of fundamental analytical performance metrics.\
  \ From the trusted brand of quality RNA reagents, Ambion\u2122 ERCC Spike-In Control\
  \ Mixes are commercially available, pre-formulated blends of 92 transcripts, derived\
  \ and traceable from NIST-certified DNA plasmids. The transcripts are designed to\
  \ be 250 to 2,000 nt in length, which mimic natural eukaryotic mRNAs."
