resourceDescription: The implementation of whole-exome sequencing in clinical diagnostics
  has generated a need for functional evaluation of genetic variants. In the field
  of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), a diverse spectrum of targeted biochemical
  assays is employed to analyze a limited amount of metabolites. We now present a
  single-platform, high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight
  (LC-QTOF) method that can be applied for holistic metabolic profiling in plasma
  of individual IEM-suspected patients. This method, which we termed "next-generation
  metabolic screening" (NGMS), can detect >10,000 features in each sample. In the
  NGMS workflow, features identified in patient and control samples are aligned using
  the "various forms of chromatography mass spectrometry (XCMS)" software package.
  Subsequently, all features are annotated using the Human Metabolome Database, and
  statistical testing is performed to identify significantly perturbed metabolite
  concentrations in a patient sample compared with controls. We propose three main
  modalities to analyze complex, untargeted metabolomics data. First, a targeted evaluation
  can be done based on identified genetic variants of uncertain significance in metabolic
  pathways. Second, we developed a panel of IEM-related metabolites to filter untargeted
  metabolomics data. Based on this IEM-panel approach, we provided the correct diagnosis
  for 42 of 46 IEMs. As a last modality, metabolomics data can be analyzed in an untargeted
  setting, which we term "open the metabolome" analysis. This approach identifies
  potential novel biomarkers in known IEMs and leads to identification of biomarkers
  for as yet unknown IEMs. We are convinced that NGMS is the way forward in laboratory
  diagnostics of IEMs. In summary, this article highligts next-generation metabolic
  screening using targeted and untargeted metabolomics for the diagnosis of inborn
  errors of metabolism in individual patients.
