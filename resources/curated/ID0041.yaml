resourceDescription: microRNAs (miRNA) expression in colorectal (CR) primary tumours
  can facilitate a more precise molecular characterization. We identified and validated
  a miRNA profile associated with clinical and histopathological features that might
  be useful for patient stratification. In situ hybridization array using paraffin-embedded
  biopsies of CR primary tumours were used to screen 1436 miRNAs. 17 miRNAs were selected
  for validation by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
  (n = 192) and were further correlated with clinical and histopathological data.
  We demonstrated that miRNAs associated to Colorectal Cancer (CRC) diagnosis age
  (over 50s and 60s) included miR-1-3p, miR-23b-3p, miR-27b-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-145-5p
  and miR-193b-5p. miR-23b-3p and miR-24-3p discriminated between Lynch Syndrome and
  sporadic CRC. miR-10a-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-642b and Let-7a-5p were associated to
  stroma abundance. miR-642b and Let-7a-5p were associated with to peritumoral inflammation
  abundance. miR-1-3p, miR-143-3p and miR-145-5p correlated with mucinous component.
  miR-326 correlated with tumour location (right or left sided). miR-1-3p associated
  with tumour grade. miR-20a-5p, miR-193b-5p, miR-320a, miR-326 and miR-642b-3p associated
  to tumour stage and progression. Remarkably, we also demonstrated that miR-1-3p
  and miR-326 expression significantly associated with patient overall survival (OS).
  Hierarchical clustering and bioinformatics analysis indicated that selected miRNAs
  could re-classify the patients and work cooperatively, modulating common target
  genes involved in colorectal cancer key signalling pathways. In conclusion, molecular
  characterization of CR primary tumours based on miRNAs could lead to more accurate
  patient reclassification and may be useful for efficient patient management.
