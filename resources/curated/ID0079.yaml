resourceDescription: Workflowhub is a registry for scientific computational workflows
  designed around FAIR principles. It allows sharing analysis workflows packaged as
  Research Object (RO) Crates with direct links to the source code on GitHub. RO-Crates
  are annoted with metadata about the workflows which faciliates findability of workflows.
  Workflowhub is sponsored by multiple European initiatives including EOSC-Life and
  ELIXIR.
