resourceDescription: Perseus, available through the MaxQuant software suite, is a
  powerful computational tool designed for the analysis and visualisation of large-scale
  proteomics and omics datasets. It offers a comprehensive set of statistical and
  computational methods, enabling researchers to explore, preprocess, and analyse
  their data. With an intuitive user interface, Perseus facilitates data quality control,
  normalisation, and downstream analysis, empowering researchers to uncover valuable
  insights. It supports a wide range of data types and provides customisable workflows,
  allowing for flexible data analysis. Utilised extensively in proteomics research,
  Perseus serves as an invaluable resource for researchers aiming to gain a deeper
  understanding of complex biological data. For detailed information see https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3901
