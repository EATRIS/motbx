resourceDescription: "With rapidly dropping sequencing cost, the popularity of whole-genome\
  \ DNA methylation sequencing has been on the rise. Multiple library preparation\
  \ protocols currently exist. We have performed 22 whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing\
  \ experiments on snap frozen human samples, and extensively benchmarked common library\
  \ preparation protocols for whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing, including three\
  \ traditional bisulfite-based protocols and a new enzyme-based protocol. In addition,\
  \ different input DNA quantities were compared for two kits compatible with a reduced\
  \ starting quantity. In addition, we also present bioinformatic analysis pipelines\
  \ for sequencing data from each of these library types. An assortment of metrics\
  \ were collected for each kit, including raw read statistics, library quality and\
  \ uniformity metrics, cytosine retention, and CpG beta value consistency between\
  \ technical replicates. Overall, the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq and Swift Accel-NGS\
  \ Methyl-Seq kits performed quantitatively better than the other two protocols.\
  \ In addition, the NEB and Swift kits performed well at low-input amounts, validating\
  \ their utility in applications where DNA is the limiting factor. The NEBNext Enzymatic\
  \ Methyl-seq kit appeared to be the best option for whole-genome DNA methylation\
  \ sequencing of high-quality DNA, closely followed by the Swift kit, which potentially\
  \ works better for degraded samples. Further, a general bioinformatic pipeline is\
  \ applicable across the four protocols, with the exception of extra trimming needed\
  \ for the Swift Biosciences\u2019s Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq protocol to remove the Adaptase\
  \ sequence."
