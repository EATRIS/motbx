resourceDescription: nf-core/methylseq is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used
  for Methylation (Bisulfite) sequencing data. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ
  inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.
  The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple
  compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker / Singularity
  containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. On release,
  automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset
  on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has
  sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits
  the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other
  analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on
  the nf-core website. The pipeline allows you to choose between running either Bismark
  or bwa-meth / MethylDackel.
