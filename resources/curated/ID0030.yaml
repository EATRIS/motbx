resourceCategory: Transcriptomics
resourceDescription: The qPCR has been introduced in clinical and biomedical research
  for over 10 years from now. Its use in trials and diagnostics is continuously increasing.
  Due to this heavy use, the question of relyability and relevance of qPCR results
  has to be asked. This review proposes a documented and evidence based answer to
  this question, thanks to the MIQE (minimum information for publication of quantitative
  real-time PCR experiments) guideline. The whole analysis process is addressed, from
  nucleic acids extraction to data management. Simple answers are given, taking into
  account the technical constraints from clinical research in order to allow a realistic
  application of this guideline.
