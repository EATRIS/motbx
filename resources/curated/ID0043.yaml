resourceDescription: Despite promising findings, quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based tests
  for RNA quantification have experienced serious limitations in their clinical application.
  The noticeable lack of technical standardization remains a huge obstacle in the
  translation of qPCR-based tests. The incorporation of qPCR-based tests into the
  clinic will benefit from guidelines for clinical research assay validation. This
  will ultimately impact the clinical management of the patient, including diagnosis,
  prognosis, prediction, monitoring of the therapeutic response, and evaluation of
  toxicity. However, clear assay validation protocols for biomarker investigation
  in clinical trials using molecular assays are currently lacking. Here, we will focus
  on the necessary steps, including sample acquisition, processing and storage, RNA
  purification, target selection, assay design, and experimental design, that need
  to be taken toward the appropriate validation of qRT-PCR assays in clinical research.
  These recommendations can fill the gap between research use only (RUO) and in vitro
  diagnostics (IVD). Our contribution provides a tool for basic and clinical research
  for the development of validated assays in the intermediate steps of biomarker research.
  These guidelines are based on the current understanding and consensus within the
  EU-CardioRNA COST Action consortium (www.cardiorna.eu). Their applicability encompasses
  all clinical areas.
