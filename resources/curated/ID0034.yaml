resourceDescription: "MicroRNAs are important negative regulators of protein-coding\
  \ gene expression and have been studied intensively over the past years. Several\
  \ measurement platforms have been developed to determine relative miRNA abundance\
  \ in biological samples using different technologies such as small RNA sequencing,\
  \ reverse transcription\u2013quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and (microarray) hybridization.\
  \ In this study, we systematically compared 12 commercially available platforms\
  \ for analysis of microRNA expression. We measured an identical set of 20 standardized\
  \ positive and negative control samples, including human universal reference RNA,\
  \ human brain RNA and titrations thereof, human serum samples and synthetic spikes\
  \ from microRNA family members with varying homology. We developed robust quality\
  \ metrics to objectively assess platform performance in terms of reproducibility,\
  \ sensitivity, accuracy, specificity and concordance of differential expression.\
  \ The results indicate that each method has its strengths and weaknesses, which\
  \ help to guide informed selection of a quantitative microRNA gene expression platform\
  \ for particular study goals."
