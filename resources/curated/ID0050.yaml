resourceDescription: Reference materials are vital to benchmarking the reproducibility
  of clinical tests and essential for monitoring laboratory performance for clinical
  proteomics. The reference material utilized for mass spectrometric analysis of the
  human proteome would ideally contain enough proteins to be suitably representative
  of the human proteome, as well as exhibit a stable protein composition in different
  batches of sample regeneration. Previously, The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis
  Consortium (CPTAC) utilized a PDX-derived comparative reference (CompRef) materials
  for the longitudinal assessment of proteomic performance; however, inherent drawbacks
  of PDX-derived material, including extended time needed to grow tumors and high
  level of expertise needed, have resulted in efforts to identify a new source of
  CompRef material. In this study, we examined the utility of using a panel of seven
  cancer cell lines, NCI-7 Cell Line Panel, as a reference material for mass spectrometric
  analysis of human proteome. Our results showed that not only is the NCI-7 material
  suitable for benchmarking laboratory sample preparation methods, but also NCI-7
  sample generation is highly reproducible at both the global and phosphoprotein levels.
  In addition, the predicted genomic and experimental coverage of the NCI-7 proteome
  suggests the NCI-7 material may also have applications as a universal standard proteomic
  reference.
