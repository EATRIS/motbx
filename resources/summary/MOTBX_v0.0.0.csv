ID0017,Genomics,Raw data processing,Identification of genomic indels and structural variations using split reads,"Recent studies have demonstrated the genetic significance of insertions, deletions, and other more complex structural variants (SVs) in the human population. With the development of the next-generation sequencing technologies, high-throughput surveys of SVs on the whole-genome level have become possible. Here we present split-read identification, calibrated (SRiC), a sequence-based method for SV detection. We start by mapping each read to the reference genome in standard fashion using gapped alignment. Then to identify SVs, we score each of the many initial mappings with an assessment strategy designed to take into account both sequencing and alignment errors (e.g. scoring more highly events gapped in the center of a read). All current SV calling methods have multilevel biases in their identifications due to both experimental and computational limitations (e.g. calling more deletions than insertions). A key aspect of our approach is that we calibrate all our calls against synthetic data sets generated from simulations of high-throughput sequencing (with realistic error models). This allows us to calculate sensitivity and the positive predictive value under different parameter-value scenarios and for different classes of events (e.g. long deletions vs. short insertions). We run our calculations on representative data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Coupling the observed numbers of events on chromosome 1 with the calibrations gleaned from the simulations (for different length events) allows us to construct a relatively unbiased estimate for the total number of SVs in the human genome across a wide range of length scales. We estimate in particular that an individual genome contains ~670,000 indels/SVs. Compared with the existing read-depth and read-pair approaches for SV identification, our method can pinpoint the exact breakpoints of SV events, reveal the actual sequence content of insertions, and cover the whole size spectrum for deletions. Moreover, with the advent of the third-generation sequencing technologies that produce longer reads, we expect our method to be even more useful.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21787423,"SRiC, genomics, publication, sequencing"

ID0019,Epigenomics,Guidelines and best practices,Evaluation of whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing library preparation protocols,"With rapidly dropping sequencing cost, the popularity of whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing has been on the rise. Multiple library preparation protocols currently exist. We have performed 22 whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing experiments on snap frozen human samples, and extensively benchmarked common library preparation protocols for whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing, including three traditional bisulfite-based protocols and a new enzyme-based protocol. In addition, different input DNA quantities were compared for two kits compatible with a reduced starting quantity. In addition, we also present bioinformatic analysis pipelines for sequencing data from each of these library types. An assortment of metrics were collected for each kit, including raw read statistics, library quality and uniformity metrics, cytosine retention, and CpG beta value consistency between technical replicates. Overall, the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq and Swift Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq kits performed quantitatively better than the other two protocols. In addition, the NEB and Swift kits performed well at low-input amounts, validating their utility in applications where DNA is the limiting factor. The NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq kit appeared to be the best option for whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing of high-quality DNA, closely followed by the Swift kit, which potentially works better for degraded samples. Further, a general bioinformatic pipeline is applicable across the four protocols, with the exception of extra trimming needed for the Swift Biosciences’s Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq protocol to remove the Adaptase sequence.",https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-021-00401-y,"epigenomics, methyl-seq, publication, sequencing"
ID0020,Epigenomics,Technical and quality checks,The SEQC2 epigenomics quality control (EpiQC) study,"Cytosine modifications in DNA such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) underlie a broad range of developmental processes, maintain cellular lineage specification, and can define or stratify types of cancer and other diseases. However, the wide variety of approaches available to interrogate these modifications has created a need for harmonized materials, methods, and rigorous benchmarking to improve genome-wide methylome sequencing applications in clinical and basic research. Here, we present a multi-platform assessment and cross-validated resource for epigenetics research from the FDA’s Epigenomics Quality Control Group. Each sample is processed in multiple replicates by three whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) protocols (TruSeq DNA methylation, Accel-NGS MethylSeq, and SPLAT), oxidative bisulfite sequencing (TrueMethyl), enzymatic deamination method (EMSeq), targeted methylation sequencing (Illumina Methyl Capture EPIC), single-molecule long-read nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and 850k Illumina methylation arrays. After rigorous quality assessment and comparison to Illumina EPIC methylation microarrays and testing on a range of algorithms (Bismark, BitmapperBS, bwa-meth, and BitMapperBS), we find overall high concordance between assays, but also differences in efficiency of read mapping, CpG capture, coverage, and platform performance, and variable performance across 26 microarray normalization algorithms. The data provided herein can guide the use of these DNA reference materials in epigenomics research, as well as provide best practices for experimental design in future studies. By leveraging seven human cell lines that are designated as publicly available reference materials, these data can be used as a baseline to advance epigenomics research.

ID0021,Epigenomics,Technical and quality checks,Comparison of EM-seq and PBAT methylome library methods for low-input DNA,"DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark involved in regulation of gene expression. For low input samples, a limited number of methods for quantifying DNA methylation genome-wide has been evaluated. Here, we compared a series of input DNA amounts (1–10ng) from two methylome library preparation protocols, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) and post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT) adapted from single-cell PBAT. EM-seq takes advantage of enzymatic activity while PBAT relies on conventional bisulfite conversion for detection of DNA methylation. We found that both methods accurately quantified DNA methylation genome-wide. They produced expected distribution patterns around genomic features, high C-T transition efficiency at non-CpG sites and high correlation between input amounts. However, EM-seq performed better in regard to library and sequencing quality, i.e. EM-seq produced larger insert sizes, higher alignment rates and higher library complexity with lower duplication rate compared to PBAT. Moreover, EM-seq demonstrated higher CpG coverage, better CpG site overlap and higher consistency between input series. In summary, our data suggests that EM-seq overall performed better than PBAT in whole-genome methylation quantification of low input samples.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15592294.2021.1997406,"EM-seq, epigenomics, methyl-seq, methylation sequencing, publication, sequencing"

ID0023,Epigenomics,Protocols,Enzymatic methyl sequencing detects DNA methylation at single-base resolution from picograms of DNA,"Bisulfite sequencing detects 5mC and 5hmC at single-base resolution. However, bisulfite treatment damages DNA, which results in fragmentation, DNA loss, and biased sequencing data. To overcome these problems, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) was developed. This method detects 5mC and 5hmC using two sets of enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction, TET2 and T4-BGT convert 5mC and 5hmC into products that cannot be deaminated by APOBEC3A. In the second reaction, APOBEC3A deaminates unmodified cytosines by converting them to uracils. Therefore, these three enzymes enable the identification of 5mC and 5hmC. EM-seq libraries were compared with bisulfite-converted DNA, and each library type was ligated to Illumina adaptors before conversion. Libraries were made using NA12878 genomic DNA, cell-free DNA, and FFPE DNA over a range of DNA inputs. The 5mC and 5hmC detected in EM-seq libraries were similar to those of bisulfite libraries. However, libraries made using EM-seq outperformed bisulfite-converted libraries in all specific measures examined (coverage, duplication, sensitivity, etc.). EM-seq libraries displayed even GC distribution, better correlations across DNA inputs, increased numbers of CpGs within genomic features, and accuracy of cytosine methylation calls. EM-seq was effective using as little as 100 pg of DNA, and these libraries maintained the described advantages over bisulfite sequencing.

ID0040,Transcriptomics,Raw data processing,Data normalization strategies for microRNA quantification,"Different technologies, such as quantitative real-time PCR or microarrays, have been developed to measure microRNA (miRNA) expression levels. Quantification of miRNA transcripts implicates data normalization using endogenous and exogenous reference genes for data correction. However, there is no consensus about an optimal normalization strategy. The choice of a reference gene remains problematic and can have a serious impact on the actual available transcript levels and, consequently, on the biological interpretation of data. In this review article we discuss the reliability of the use of small RNAs, commonly reported in the literature as miRNA expression normalizers, and compare different strategies used for data normalization. A workflow strategy is proposed for normalization of miRNA expression data in an attempt to provide a basis for the establishment of a global standard procedure that will allow comparison across studies.",https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/61/11/1333/5611589,"data processing, guidelines, miRNAs, normalization, protocol, publication, qPCR, transcriptomics"
ID0041,Transcriptomics,Preclinical use cases,Novel molecular characterization of colorectal primary tumors based on miRNAs,"microRNAs (miRNA) expression in colorectal (CR) primary tumours can facilitate a more precise molecular characterization. We identified and validated a miRNA profile associated with clinical and histopathological features that might be useful for patient stratification. In situ hybridization array using paraffin-embedded biopsies of CR primary tumours were used to screen 1436 miRNAs. 17 miRNAs were selected for validation by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (n = 192) and were further correlated with clinical and histopathological data. We demonstrated that miRNAs associated to Colorectal Cancer (CRC) diagnosis age (over 50s and 60s) included miR-1-3p, miR-23b-3p, miR-27b-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-145-5p and miR-193b-5p. miR-23b-3p and miR-24-3p discriminated between Lynch Syndrome and sporadic CRC. miR-10a-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-642b and Let-7a-5p were associated to stroma abundance. miR-642b and Let-7a-5p were associated with to peritumoral inflammation abundance. miR-1-3p, miR-143-3p and miR-145-5p correlated with mucinous component. miR-326 correlated with tumour location (right or left sided). miR-1-3p associated with tumour grade. miR-20a-5p, miR-193b-5p, miR-320a, miR-326 and miR-642b-3p associated to tumour stage and progression. Remarkably, we also demonstrated that miR-1-3p and miR-326 expression significantly associated with patient overall survival (OS). Hierarchical clustering and bioinformatics analysis indicated that selected miRNAs could re-classify the patients and work cooperatively, modulating common target genes involved in colorectal cancer key signalling pathways. In conclusion, molecular characterization of CR primary tumours based on miRNAs could lead to more accurate patient reclassification and may be useful for efficient patient management.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/11/3/346,"RT-qPCR, miRNAs, microRNA array profiling, preclinical use case, publication, qPCR, transcriptomics"

Here, we validated for the first time 18 distinct microRNAs (miRNAs) detected in serum and primary tumor samples, three germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) genes, and low levels of Notch 1 expression in the primary tumor as predictive biomarkers of different features. Specifically, these markers were associated with a favorable response to treatment, disease stage, and relapse, as well as the appearance of asthenia.

The incorporation of qPCR-based tests into the clinic will benefit from guidelines for clinical research assay validation. This will ultimately impact the clinical management of the patient, including diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, monitoring of the therapeutic response, and evaluation of toxicity. However, clear assay validation protocols for biomarker investigation in clinical trials using molecular assays are currently lacking. Here, we will focus on the necessary steps, including sample acquisition, processing and storage, RNA purification, target selection, assay design, and experimental design, that need to be taken toward the appropriate validation of qRT-PCR assays in clinical research. These recommendations can fill the gap between research use only (RUO) and in vitro diagnostics (IVD).

Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to quality control is an essential requirement to inspire confidence in the generated results. A typical mass spectrometry experiment consists of multiple different phases including the sample preparation, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics stages. We review potential sources of variability that can impact the results of a mass spectrometry experiment occurring in all of these steps, and we discuss how to monitor and remedy the negative influences on the experimental results. Furthermore, we describe how specialized quality control samples of varying sample complexity can be incorporated into the experimental workflow and how they can be used to rigorously assess detailed aspects of the instrument performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28802010/,"mass spectrometry, proteomics, publication, quality control"

To address this need, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reference material (RM) 8323 yeast protein extract is introduced as a proteomics quality control material for benchmarking the preanalytical and analytical performance of proteomics-based experimental workflows. RM 8323 yeast protein extract is based upon the well-characterized eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and can be utilized in the design and optimization of proteomics-based methodologies from sample preparation to data analysis. To demonstrate its utility as a proteomics quality control material, we coupled LC-MS/MS measurements of RM 8323 with the NIST MS Quality Control (MSQC) performance metrics to quantitatively assess the LC-MS/MS instrumentation parameters that influence measurement accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility. Due to the complexity of the yeast proteome, we also demonstrate how NIST RM 8323, along with the NIST MSQC performance metrics, can be used in the evaluation and optimization of proteomics-based sample preparation methods.",https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.201100522,"mass spectrometry, proteomics, publication, quality assessment, quality control, workflow"

Here, we employ Plasma Proteome Profiling to define quality marker panels to assess plasma samples and the likelihood that suggested biomarkers are instead artifacts related to sample handling and processing. We acquire deep reference proteomes of erythrocytes, platelets, plasma, and whole blood of 20 individuals (> 6,000 proteins), and compare serum and plasma proteomes. Based on spike-in experiments, we determine sample quality-associated proteins, many of which have been reported as biomarker candidates as revealed by a comprehensive literature survey.

ID0047,Proteomics,Samples processing,"A novel LC system embeds analytes in pre-formed gradients for rapid, ultra-robust proteomics","To further integrate mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics into biomedical research and especially into clinical settings, high throughput and robustness are essential requirements. They are largely met in high-flow rate chromatographic systems for small molecules but these are not sufficiently sensitive for proteomics applications. Here we describe a new concept that delivers on these requirements while maintaining the sensitivity of current nano-flow LC systems. Low-pressure pumps elute the sample from a disposable trap column, simultaneously forming a chromatographic gradient that is stored in a long storage loop. An auxiliary gradient creates an offset, ensuring the re-focusing of the peptides before the separation on the analytical column by a single high-pressure pump. This simplified design enables robust operation over thousands of sample injections. Furthermore, the steps between injections are performed in parallel, reducing overhead time to a few minutes and allowing analysis of more than 200 samples per day. From fractionated HeLa cell lysates, deep proteomes covering more than 130,000 sequence unique peptides and close to 10,000 proteins were rapidly acquired. Using this data as a library, we demonstrate quantitation of 5200 proteins in only 21 min. Thus, the new system - termed Evosep One - analyzes samples in an extremely robust and high throughput manner, without sacrificing in depth proteomics coverage.",https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(20)32029-6/fulltext,"mass spectrometry, proteomics, protocol, publication, study design"

However, due to its unique protein composition, performing proteomics assays with plasma is challenging. Plasma proteomics has regained interest due to recent technological advances, but challenges imposed by both complications inherent to studying human biology (e.g., interindividual variability) and analysis of biospecimens (e.g., sample variability), as well as technological limitations remain. As part of the Human Proteome Project (HPP), the Human Plasma Proteome Project (HPPP) brings together key aspects of the plasma proteomics pipeline. Here, we provide considerations and recommendations concerning study design, plasma collection, quality metrics, plasma processing workflows, mass spectrometry (MS) data acquisition, data processing, and bioinformatic analysis.

ID0050,Proteomics,Reference material,Evaluation of NCI-7 cell line panel as a reference material for clinical proteomics,"Reference materials are vital to benchmarking the reproducibility of clinical tests and essential for monitoring laboratory performance for clinical proteomics. The reference material utilized for mass spectrometric analysis of the human proteome would ideally contain enough proteins to be suitably representative of the human proteome, as well as exhibit a stable protein composition in different batches of sample regeneration. Previously, The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) utilized a PDX-derived comparative reference (CompRef) materials for the longitudinal assessment of proteomic performance; however, inherent drawbacks of PDX-derived material, including extended time needed to grow tumors and high level of expertise needed, have resulted in efforts to identify a new source of CompRef material. In this study, we examined the utility of using a panel of seven cancer cell lines, NCI-7 Cell Line Panel, as a reference material for mass spectrometric analysis of human proteome. Our results showed that not only is the NCI-7 material suitable for benchmarking laboratory sample preparation methods, but also NCI-7 sample generation is highly reproducible at both the global and phosphoprotein levels. In addition, the predicted genomic and experimental coverage of the NCI-7 proteome suggests the NCI-7 material may also have applications as a universal standard proteomic reference.",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00165,"clinical guidelines, mass spectrometry, proteomics, publication, reference material, samples"

Here, we introduce a rapid and robust “plasma proteome profiling” pipeline. This single-run shotgun proteomic workflow does not require protein depletion and enables quantitative analysis of hundreds of plasma proteomes from 1 μl single finger pricks with 20 min gradients. The apolipoprotein family, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, gender-related proteins, and >40 FDA-approved biomarkers are reproducibly quantified (CV <20% with label-free quantification).

This review aims to highlight current RMs, and methodologies used within untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics communities to ensure standardization of results obtained from data analysis, interpretation and cross-study, and cross laboratory comparisons. The essence of the aims is also applicable to other ‘omics areas that generate high dimensional data. The potential for game-changing biochemical discoveries through mass spectrometry-based (MS) untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics are predicated on the evolution of more confident qualitative (and eventually quantitative) results from research laboratories. RMs are thus critical QC tools to be able to assure standardization, comparability, repeatability and reproducibility for untargeted data analysis, interpretation, to compare data within and across studies and across multiple laboratories. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) that promote, describe and exemplify the use of RMs will also improve QC for the metabolomics and lipidomics communities. The application of RMs described in this review may significantly improve data quality to support metabolomics and lipidomics research. The continued development and deployment of new RMs, together with interlaboratory studies and educational outreach and training, will further promote sound QA practices in the community.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-021-01848-6,"lipidomics, mass spectrometry, metabolomics, publication, quality assurance, quality control, reference materials"
ID0059,Metabolomics,Guidelines and best practices,Dissemination and analysis of the quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) practices of LC–MS based untargeted metabolomics practitioners,"The metabolomics quality assurance and quality control consortium (mQACC) evolved from the recognized need for a community-wide consensus on improving and systematizing quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) practices for untargeted metabolomics. Objectives: In this work, we sought to identify and share the common and divergent QA and QC practices amongst mQACC members and collaborators who use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) in untargeted metabolomics. All authors voluntarily participated in this collaborative research project by providing the details of and insights into the QA and QC practices used in their laboratories. This sharing was enabled via a six-page questionnaire composed of over 120 questions and comment fields which was developed as part of this work and has proved the basis for ongoing mQACC outreach: For QA, many laboratories reported documenting maintenance, calibration and tuning (82%); having established data storage and archival processes (71%); depositing data in public repositories (55%); having standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place for all laboratory processes (68%) and training staff on laboratory processes (55%). For QC, universal practices included using system suitability procedures (100%) and using a robust system of identification (Metabolomics Standards Initiative level 1 identification standards) for at least some of the detected compounds. Most laboratories used QC samples (>86%); used internal standards (91%); used a designated analytical acquisition template with randomized experimental samples (91%); and manually reviewed peak integration following data acquisition (86%). A minority of laboratories included technical replicates of experimental samples in their workflows (36%). Although the 23 contributors were researchers with diverse and international backgrounds from academia, industry and government, they are not necessarily representative of the worldwide pool of practitioners due to the recruitment method for participants and its voluntary nature. However, both questionnaire and the findings presented here have already informed and led other data gathering efforts by mQACC at conferences and other outreach activities and will continue to evolve in order to guide discussions for recommendations of best practices within the community and to establish internationally agreed upon reporting standards.

ID0060,Metabolomics,Guidelines and best practices,Quality assurance and quality control reporting in untargeted metabolic phenotyping: mQACC recommendations for analytical quality management,"Demonstrating that the data produced in metabolic phenotyping investigations (metabolomics/metabonomics) is of good quality is increasingly seen as a key factor in gaining acceptance for the results of such studies. The use of established quality control (QC) protocols, including appropriate QC samples, is an important and evolving aspect of this process. However, inadequate or incorrect reporting of the QA/QC procedures followed in the study may lead to misinterpretation or overemphasis of the findings and prevent future metanalysis of the body of work. The aim of this guidance is to provide researchers with a framework that encourages them to describe quality assessment and quality control procedures and outcomes in mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectros copy-based methods in untargeted metabolomics, with a focus on reporting on QC samples in sufficient detail for them to be understood, trusted and replicated. There is no intent to be proscriptive with regard to analytical best practices; rather, guidance for reporting QA/QC procedures is suggested. A template that can be completed as studies progress to ensure that relevant data is collected, and further documents, are provided as on-line resources. Multiple topics should be considered when reporting QA/QC protoco ls and outcomes for metabolic phenotyping data. Coverage should include the role(s), sources, types, preparation and uses of the QC materials and samples generally employed in the generation of metabolomic data. Details such as sample matrices and sample preparation, the use of test mixtures and system suitability tests, blanks and technique-specific factors are considered and methods for reporting are discussed, including the importance of reporting the acceptance criteria for the QCs. To this end, the reporting of the QC samples and results are considered at two levels of detail: “minimal” and “best reporting practice” levels.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-022-01926-3,"metabolomics, publication, quality assurance, quality control, reference materials"

ID0064,Metabolomics,Clinical use cases,Next-generation metabolic screening: targeted and untargeted metabolomics for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in individual patients.,"The implementation of whole-exome sequencing in clinical diagnostics has generated a need for functional evaluation of genetic variants. In the field of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), a diverse spectrum of targeted biochemical assays is employed to analyze a limited amount of metabolites. We now present a single-platform, high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight (LC-QTOF) method that can be applied for holistic metabolic profiling in plasma of individual IEM-suspected patients. This method, which we termed ""next-generation metabolic screening"" (NGMS), can detect >10,000 features in each sample. In the NGMS workflow, features identified in patient and control samples are aligned using the ""various forms of chromatography mass spectrometry (XCMS)"" software package. Subsequently, all features are annotated using the Human Metabolome Database, and statistical testing is performed to identify significantly perturbed metabolite concentrations in a patient sample compared with controls. We propose three main modalities to analyze complex, untargeted metabolomics data. First, a targeted evaluation can be done based on identified genetic variants of uncertain significance in metabolic pathways. Second, we developed a panel of IEM-related metabolites to filter untargeted metabolomics data. Based on this IEM-panel approach, we provided the correct diagnosis for 42 of 46 IEMs. As a last modality, metabolomics data can be analyzed in an untargeted setting, which we term ""open the metabolome"" analysis. This approach identifies potential novel biomarkers in known IEMs and leads to identification of biomarkers for as yet unknown IEMs. We are convinced that NGMS is the way forward in laboratory diagnostics of IEMs. In summary, this article highligts next-generation metabolic screening using targeted and untargeted metabolomics for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in individual patients.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10545-017-0131-6,"NGS, biomarkers, metabolomics, protocol, publication, whole-exome sequencing"
