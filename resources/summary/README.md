# MOTBX resources summary

This folder contains CSV files summarising MOTBX resources in [`../resources/curated`](https://github.com/EATRIS/motbx/tree/main/resources/curated).

The latest MOTBX version is indicated in [`../resources/MOTBX_version.yaml`](https://github.com/EATRIS/motbx/blob/main/resources/MOTBX_version.yaml).

Accordingly, files in this folder include
* A CSV file summarising all resources present in the latest version: `MOTBX_vx.x.x.csv`. This file includes resources that failed validation.
* The CSV file `MOTBX_vx.x.x_excl_invalid.csv` has the same content as the one above but only inludes resources that passed validation.
* A report summarising validation issues: `validation_report_vx.x.x.txt`
* A CSV file summarising all changes between the latest version and previous version: `changelog_vx.x.x.csv`

Summaries and log files of previous versions are also contained in this folder.
