### Multi-omics Toolbox (MOTBX)

The EATRIS [Multi-omics Toolbox (MOTBX)](<insert-link-to-motbx>) is a community-driven comprehensive knowledge base aimed at supporting researchers in academia and industry who are involved in the development, implementation, and adoption of multi-omics approaches for personalised medicine. MOTBX collects a rich selection of resources, including best practices, protocols for individual omics technologies, and tools for quality control and assessment. <MOTBX is available at insert-link.>

### This repository

This repository collects resources for MOTBX, a data model defing the structure of resources, and tools to maintain them.

| Folder / File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **`notebooks/`** | Jupyter notebooks
| &emsp; `schema.ipynb` | Define JSON schema
| &emsp; `validate.ipynb` | Validate resource against JSON schema
| &emsp; `ext_biotoolsAPI.ipynb` | Query bio.tools registry using API
| &emsp; `ext_FAIRsharingAPI.ipynb` | Query FAIRsharing registry using API
| **`resources/`** 
| &emsp; `curated/*.yaml` | Curated MOTBX resources
| &emsp; `external/*.yaml` | MOTBX resources from added from external databases
| **`schema/`**
| &emsp; `motbxschema.json` | JSON Schema defining MOTBX resource structure
| **`test/`** | Files for testing

## Use tools

A set of Jupyter notebooks provide functionality to create/modify the schema and validate resources.

### Install Conda environment and Jupyter

1. Install Miniconda3 (Conda 23.5.2 Python 3.11.3 released July 13, 2023)

2. Install *notebook* and Jupyter kernels (*nb_conda_kernels*) to Conda base environment
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge notebook
    conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels
    ```

3. Create new environment and register kernel for Jupyter
    ```
    conda create -n motbxtools python=3.11 
    conda activate motbxtools
    conda install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=motbxtools --display-name "Python 3.11 (motbxtools)"
    conda install -c anaconda requests
    conda install -c conda-forge pyyaml
    conda install -c conda-forge jsonschema
    ```

4. Run Jupyter notebook from base environment
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
