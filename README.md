The EATRIS [Multi-omics Toolbox (MOTBX)](https://motbx.eatris.eu/) is a community-driven comprehensive knowledge base aimed at supporting researchers in academia and industry who are involved in the development, implementation, and adoption of multi-omics approaches for personalised medicine. MOTBX collects a rich selection of resources, including best practices, protocols for individual omics technologies, and tools for quality control and assessment. MOTBX is available at https://motbx.eatris.eu/.
