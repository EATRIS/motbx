1,Quality Control and Assessment,Guidelines and best practices,ISO Guide 80:2014: Guidance for in-house preparation of quality control materials,"ISO Guide 80:2014 guidance for the in-house preparation of quality control materials (QCMs). ISO Guide 80 outlines the characteristics and preparation processes of reference materials for quality control. It applies to stable materials used locally and those transported without significant property changes. Laboratory staff preparing in-house quality control materials should follow ISO Guides 34 and 35 for transportation-based supply chains. The preparation of quality control materials requires assessments for homogeneity, stability, and limited characterization. It aims to demonstrate statistical control in a measurement system but does not provide usage guidance. The guide offers general information on preparation and includes case studies for different sectors. Users should have material knowledge and be aware of matrix effects and contamination risks.",https://www.iso.org/standard/44313.html,"ISO standard, guidelines, quality control material, in-house, genomics",
