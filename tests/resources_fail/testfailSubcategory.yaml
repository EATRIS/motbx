resourceDescription: ISO Guide 80:2014 guidance for the in-house preparation of quality
  control materials (QCMs). ISO Guide 80 outlines the characteristics and preparation
  processes of reference materials for quality control. It applies to stable materials
  used locally and those transported without significant property changes. Laboratory
  staff preparing in-house quality control materials should follow ISO Guides 34 and
  35 for transportation-based supply chains. The preparation of quality control materials
  requires assessments for homogeneity, stability, and limited characterization. It
  aims to demonstrate statistical control in a measurement system but does not provide
  usage guidance. The guide offers general information on preparation and includes
  case studies for different sectors. Users should have material knowledge and be
  aware of matrix effects and contamination risks.
